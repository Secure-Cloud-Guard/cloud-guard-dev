## Introduction

The **Cloud Guard** project addresses the critical issue of data security in cloud storage, where data is hosted on third-party servers. While various data encryption methods are commonly used, cloud service providers still have access to unencrypted data. This project aims to propose a solution for securing data in cloud storage to prevent unauthorized access by providers while minimizing the overhead associated with data encryption and decryption at the user's side.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **cloud-guard-client:** This folder contains the client-side web application of the project. It appears to be a separate GitHub project; please refer to its own documentation for details.

- **cloud-guard-server:** Future developments will include this component.

- **docker-compose.yaml:** This file defines the Docker Compose configuration for deploying the project.

## Getting Started
